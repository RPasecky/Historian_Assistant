# Franz Boas: Father of American Anthropology

## European Formation (1858-1886)

Franz Uri Boas was born on July 9, 1858, at Minden, Westphalia, in the Kingdom of Prussia (now Germany), at his family's home on Obermarktstraße. His father, Meier Boas, was a prosperous merchant; his mother, Sophie Meyer, was a well-educated woman who had participated in the failed democratic revolutions of 1848. The household was secular and liberal, embracing Enlightenment ideals despite their Jewish heritage.

On October 20, 1877, Boas matriculated at the University of Heidelberg, studying physics and geography. He transferred to the University of Bonn in the spring of 1879, then to the University of Kiel, where he completed his doctorate on July 12, 1881. His dissertation, "Contributions to the Understanding of the Color of Water," was defended in the university's examination hall and reflected his early commitment to empirical science.

A transformative experience occurred from June 1883 to September 1884, when Boas conducted geographical research on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Departing from Bremen aboard the Germania on June 19, 1883, he lived among the Inuit for fourteen months. This fieldwork, based at a camp near Cumberland Sound, fundamentally altered his intellectual trajectory. He observed that Inuit geographical knowledge was as sophisticated as European science, challenging racial hierarchies of intelligence. His diary entries, written in frigid conditions at his tent on Baffin Island, reveal his conversion from physical geography to cultural anthropology.

Returning to Germany on October 12, 1884, Boas struggled to find academic employment. On March 10, 1885, he married Marie Krackowizer, an Austrian-American woman he had met in New York, at the Rathaus (city hall) in Minden. The couple immediately departed for New York, arriving on March 25, 1885, aboard the steamer Elbe at Castle Garden immigration station in Lower Manhattan. Boas hoped America would offer opportunities denied him in Germany due to antisemitism.

## American Beginnings (1886-1899)

Boas's early years in America were financially precarious. On May 15, 1886, he was hired as assistant editor of Science magazine, working from offices at 47 Lafayette Place in Manhattan. The position paid poorly but connected him to American scientific networks. On October 3, 1886, he received his first major American commission: to study the Native American peoples of British Columbia for the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

From June through September 1886, and again in 1888, 1889, 1890, and 1894, Boas conducted fieldwork among the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, particularly the Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) of coastal British Columbia. His base was often Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island, where he lived in the homes of native informants, learning languages and recording cultural practices. These expeditions, documented in field notebooks written at campsites and villages across British Columbia, provided the empirical foundation for his revolutionary theories of cultural relativism.

On January 3, 1889, Boas was appointed docent in anthropology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, the first anthropology position at an American university. He taught from offices in Jonas Clark Hall and built a small but dedicated program. However, a dispute with university president G. Stanley Hall led to his resignation on December 15, 1892. Once again unemployed, with a growing family (he would father six children between 1887 and 1902), Boas faced an uncertain future.

Salvation came from an unexpected source. On June 14, 1893, Frederic Ward Putnam, chief of the Department of Ethnology at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, hired Boas to organize anthropological exhibits. Working from offices at the fairgrounds in Jackson Park, Boas assembled massive collections of artifacts and even brought native peoples to demonstrate their cultures, though he later regretted these "human exhibits." The exposition, visited by millions between May 1 and October 30, 1893, introduced American audiences to systematic anthropology.

## Columbia and Institutional Power (1896-1920)

On October 1, 1896, Boas was appointed lecturer in physical anthropology at Columbia University, teaching from a small office in the old Columbia campus at 49th Street and Madison Avenue. The position was part-time and unpaid initially, but on July 1, 1899, he was promoted to professor of anthropology with a salary—the first such professorship in America. When Columbia moved to Morningside Heights, Boas worked from offices in Schermerhorn Hall at 116th Street and Broadway, beginning in October 1897.

Simultaneously, on October 15, 1896, he was appointed curator of the Department of Anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History, located on Central Park West at 79th Street. For several years, Boas held both positions, organizing expeditions, supervising students, and building collections. His office at the museum became a center for American anthropology.

However, conflicts with museum president Morris Jesup over exhibition philosophy led to Boas's resignation from the museum on July 1, 1905. Jesup preferred spectacular displays for public entertainment; Boas insisted on scientifically rigorous presentations. After a bitter dispute conducted through letters exchanged between Boas's Columbia office and Jesup's office at 16 Wall Street, Boas departed the museum to focus entirely on Columbia.

At Columbia, Boas transformed American anthropology. On September 15, 1901, he began teaching his first cohort of graduate students who would become the discipline's leaders: Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie, Edward Sapir, and Ruth Benedict (who enrolled in 1919). Classes were held in Schermerhorn Hall, where Boas lectured in a thick German accent, chain-smoking cigarettes and covering blackboards with diagrams.

His most influential work, "The Mind of Primitive Man," was published on October 12, 1911, by Macmillan (headquarters at 66 Fifth Avenue). Written primarily in his study at his home at 222 West 82nd Street (where the family had moved in 1906), the book demolished scientific racism by demonstrating that intelligence and cultural achievement were independent of race. On November 3, 1911, he presented the book's arguments at a lecture in Columbia's Philosophy Hall, attended by faculty and students.

## Public Intellectual and Controversies (1919-1942)

Boas's opposition to World War I and his public criticism of anthropologists who spied for the U.S. government led to professional censure. On December 20, 1919, at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association held at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the association voted to censure Boas for accusing four anthropologists of espionage. Though the censure was later rescinded, the incident revealed professional tensions around his political outspokenness.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Boas became increasingly engaged in public debates about race and immigration. On May 15, 1924, following passage of the Immigration Act restricting immigration from southern and eastern Europe, Boas published a scathing critique in The Nation magazine (offices at 20 Vesey Street, Manhattan), arguing the law was based on pseudoscientific racism. His opposition to eugenics and racial theories made him a target of conservative criticism.

On April 30, 1933, two months after Hitler became German Chancellor, Boas's books were burned in Berlin. He learned of this on May 2, 1933, when a telegram arrived at his Columbia office. A German-Jewish émigré who had become America's leading anthropologist, Boas now watched his homeland descend into barbarism. He redoubled his efforts to combat racism, publishing "Race and Democratic Society" on March 15, 1945 (posthumously).

His final years were spent at Columbia, where he continued teaching despite mandatory retirement at age seventy in 1936. The university created a special emeritus position allowing him to continue. On December 21, 1942, at age eighty-four, Boas attended a faculty luncheon at the Columbia University Faculty Club at 116th Street and Broadway. At approximately 1:15 PM, while discussing the need to combat racism in wartime America, he collapsed at the table and died instantly of a heart attack, falling into the arms of Claude Lévi-Strauss, the French anthropologist.

A memorial service was held on December 23, 1942, at the Riverside Memorial Chapel at Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street. Colleagues, students, and family filled the chapel to honor the man who had single-handedly created modern American anthropology. He was buried on December 24 at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Tarrytown, New York, with a simple gravestone bearing his name and dates.

Boas's legacy extended far beyond academia. His students—Kroeber, Benedict, Sapir, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, and dozens more—carried his methods and commitments throughout American universities. His insistence that cultures must be understood on their own terms, not judged by European standards, laid the foundation for cultural relativism. His meticulous demolition of scientific racism provided intellectual ammunition for the civil rights movement. And his model of anthropology as a holistic, four-field discipline (physical anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, and cultural anthropology) organized American departments for generations.

From his offices at Columbia, his home on West 82nd Street, and fieldwork sites across the Americas, Franz Boas waged a lifelong campaign against racism, ethnocentrism, and intellectual complacency. A German-Jewish immigrant who made New York his intellectual home, he transformed anthropology from a Victorian exercise in cataloging "primitive" peoples into a rigorous science of human diversity—one committed to demonstrating the fundamental equality of all human groups and the rich particularity of every culture. His death in 1942, at a moment when racial ideology threatened to destroy civilization, carried particular poignancy. But his intellectual legacy endured, shaping not only anthropology but broader American understandings of culture, race, and human possibility.
