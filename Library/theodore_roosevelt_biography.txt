# Theodore Roosevelt: The New York Dynamo

## Privileged Beginnings (1858-1880)

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at 28 East 20th Street in Manhattan, in a four-story brownstone townhouse between Broadway and Park Avenue South. His father, Theodore Roosevelt Sr., was a wealthy glass importer and philanthropist; his mother, Martha "Mittie" Bulloch, was a Southern belle from Georgia. Young "Teedie," as the family called him, was a sickly child who suffered from debilitating asthma, spending many nights gasping for breath in the family's parlor.

In 1872, the family moved to a new residence at 6 West 57th Street. It was here, in the home gymnasium on the second floor, that fourteen-year-old Theodore began his transformation through vigorous exercise. His father had told him, "You have the mind, but you have not the body, and without the help of the body the mind cannot go as far as it should." Theodore took this challenge to heart, spending hours lifting weights and boxing.

On September 27, 1876, Roosevelt enrolled at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, residing initially at 16 Winthrop Street. Despite his privileged background, he threw himself into his studies with characteristic intensity. On February 9, 1878, while home for winter break at the family's residence at 6 West 57th Street, Theodore received devastating news: his father had died suddenly of stomach cancer at age forty-six. This loss profoundly shaped Roosevelt, intensifying his drive to live strenuously and serve others.

On October 27, 1880, his twenty-second birthday, Roosevelt married Alice Hathaway Lee at the Unitarian Church in Brookline, Massachusetts. The couple honeymooned at his family's estate, Tranquility, in Oyster Bay, Long Island. That same fall, he enrolled at Columbia Law School, located at 49 West 49th Street in Manhattan, though he would never complete his degree, finding politics more compelling than legal practice.

## Political Ascent and Tragedy (1881-1886)

On November 8, 1881, at age twenty-three, Roosevelt was elected to the New York State Assembly from the 21st District, representing Manhattan's Upper East Side. He took his seat on January 2, 1882, at the State Capitol in Albany. His fellow assemblymen initially dismissed the bespectacled Harvard graduate as a dilettante, but Roosevelt's energy, intelligence, and moral fervor soon commanded respect.

The twin tragedies that defined Roosevelt's life occurred on February 14, 1884, at 6 West 57th Street. In the early morning hours, his mother, Mittie, died of typhoid fever on the third floor. Eleven hours later, in a room on the second floor of the same house, his wife Alice died of Bright's disease (kidney failure), two days after giving birth to their daughter, also named Alice. Roosevelt drew a large X in his diary and wrote, "The light has gone out of my life." He never spoke publicly of Alice again.

Devastated, Roosevelt departed New York on June 9, 1884, for the Dakota Territory. He purchased a ranch near Medora and threw himself into the life of a cattleman, residing at the Maltese Cross Ranch. For two years, he lived a dual existence: ranching in Dakota during summers and autumns, returning to New York City for winters to work on his historical writings at 689 Madison Avenue, a home purchased by his sister Anna.

On December 2, 1886, at St. George's Church on Rutherford Place in Manhattan, Roosevelt married Edith Kermit Carow, a childhood friend. They settled at Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay, the house Roosevelt had begun building for Alice. This estate would remain his permanent residence and the center of his political operations for the rest of his life.

## Building a National Reputation (1889-1898)

On May 7, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the United States Civil Service Commission, requiring him to maintain an office in Washington while keeping his family at Sagamore Hill. He served energetically until May 5, 1895, when he accepted appointment as President of the New York City Board of Police Commissioners, headquartered at 300 Mulberry Street in Manhattan.

Roosevelt's tenure at Mulberry Street became legendary. He famously conducted midnight rambles, walking the streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side, Bowery, and Five Points neighborhood to catch policemen sleeping on duty or taking bribes. On June 7, 1895, at 2:00 AM, he discovered Patrolman William Rath asleep in a doorway at Third Avenue and 158th Street and filed charges the next morning at headquarters. Such actions made him a celebrity reformer, regularly featured in newspaper accounts.

On April 19, 1897, President William McKinley appointed Roosevelt Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He worked from offices in the State, War, and Navy Building (now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) in Washington. On February 25, 1898, with Secretary John D. Long absent, Roosevelt sent the famous cable to Commodore George Dewey in Hong Kong, positioning the Asiatic Squadron to attack the Spanish fleet at Manila—a move that would prove decisive when war was declared on April 25, 1898.

Unable to resist active service, Roosevelt resigned on May 6, 1898, and organized the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, the "Rough Riders," at San Antonio, Texas. On July 1, 1898, at the Battle of San Juan Heights near Santiago, Cuba, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt led his men in the celebrated charge up Kettle Hill. This act of courage, widely reported in American newspapers, transformed him into a national hero.

## Governor and Vice President (1898-1901)

Returning to New York aboard the transport ship Miami on August 15, 1898, Roosevelt was greeted as a conquering hero. The Republican Party, needing to capitalize on his popularity and distance itself from the corrupt political machine of Senator Thomas Platt, nominated him for governor. On November 8, 1898, Roosevelt won the election and took office on January 2, 1899, at the State Capitol in Albany.

As governor, Roosevelt worked from the Executive Mansion at 138 Eagle Street in Albany but maintained close contact with New York City, regularly taking the night train to consult with reformers and political allies. On March 30, 1899, he signed the Civil Service Reform Act in his Capitol office, extending merit-based hiring across state government. On April 21, 1899, he signed a landmark factory inspection law in the Governor's chambers, earning the enmity of corporate interests but the admiration of progressive reformers.

Senator Platt, finding Roosevelt too independent, orchestrated his "promotion" to the vice presidency to remove him from New York politics. On June 21, 1900, at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Roosevelt reluctantly accepted the vice-presidential nomination. On November 6, 1900, the McKinley-Roosevelt ticket won decisively, and on March 4, 1901, Roosevelt took the oath of office as Vice President at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.

The vice presidency bored Roosevelt intensely. He presided over the Senate from March through May, then retreated to Sagamore Hill for the summer. On September 6, 1901, he was vacationing with his family at a lodge on Lake Champlain in Vermont when a park ranger arrived with urgent news: President McKinley had been shot in Buffalo. Roosevelt rushed to Buffalo, but when McKinley seemed to improve, departed on September 10 for a hiking trip in the Adirondacks.

## The Accidental President (1901-1909)

On September 13, 1901, at 1:30 PM, a guide reached Roosevelt at a cabin on Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks with a telegram: McKinley was dying. Roosevelt descended the mountain through the night, traveling by wagon to North Creek, then by special train to Buffalo. On September 14, 1901, at 3:30 PM, at the Ansley Wilcox House at 641 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, the forty-two-year-old Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office as the twenty-sixth President of the United States—the youngest man ever to hold the office.

Roosevelt's presidency transformed the role of the federal government. On February 19, 1902, he filed suit against the Northern Securities Company under the Sherman Antitrust Act, with the case argued before the Supreme Court in Washington. The successful prosecution, decided on March 14, 1904, established the federal government's authority to regulate corporate power and earned Roosevelt his reputation as a "trust buster."

On August 24, 1902, Roosevelt issued executive orders creating Pelican Island in Florida as the first federal bird reservation, the beginning of the national wildlife refuge system. Working from his office in the White House, he would ultimately protect approximately 230 million acres of public land—a conservation legacy unmatched by any president before or since.

Perhaps his most controversial domestic action occurred on February 22, 1904, when he ordered the seizure of Panama Canal Zone territory, working from the Cabinet Room in the White House. Construction of the canal, which Roosevelt considered his greatest achievement, began on May 4, 1904. On November 9, 1906, Roosevelt became the first sitting president to travel outside the United States when he visited the construction site at Colón, Panama, personally operating a steam shovel for photographers.

On November 8, 1904, Roosevelt won election to a full term in his own right. The following year, on September 5, 1905, he mediated the end of the Russo-Japanese War at a conference held at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. For this diplomatic achievement, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1906, becoming the first American to receive a Nobel Prize in any category.

## Post-Presidency and Final Years (1909-1919)

Roosevelt's chosen successor, William Howard Taft, was inaugurated on March 4, 1909. Roosevelt immediately departed for a safari in Africa and a triumphal tour of Europe, not returning to New York until June 18, 1910, when he landed at Battery Park to a massive reception. However, his disillusionment with Taft's conservatism grew, and on February 24, 1912, speaking at the Ohio Constitutional Convention in Columbus, he announced his return to politics, declaring, "My hat is in the ring."

On August 5, 1912, at Orchestra Hall in Chicago, Roosevelt accepted the nomination of the Progressive "Bull Moose" Party for president. On October 14, 1912, at the Hotel Gilpatrick in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a would-be assassin shot Roosevelt in the chest as he entered his automobile. The bullet was slowed by his eyeglass case and the 50-page speech in his breast pocket. Roosevelt insisted on delivering his scheduled speech at the Milwaukee Auditorium, beginning, "Friends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible. I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot."

The three-way race resulted in Woodrow Wilson's victory, with Roosevelt outpolling Taft but failing to win the presidency. He returned to Sagamore Hill and resumed writing, producing his autobiography and numerous articles from his study overlooking Oyster Bay.

When World War I erupted in Europe, Roosevelt became an outspoken advocate for American intervention. On April 6, 1917, the day Congress declared war on Germany, he was at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in Manhattan, celebrating. At age fifty-eight, he requested permission to raise a volunteer division for service in France, meeting with President Wilson at the White House on May 19, 1917. Wilson denied the request, but all four of Roosevelt's sons served in the war.

On July 17, 1918, Roosevelt received the devastating news at Sagamore Hill that his youngest son, Quentin, a pilot, had been killed in aerial combat over France. The loss broke Roosevelt's spirit. His health, never robust since the Amazon expedition of 1913-14, deteriorated rapidly. On November 11, 1918, Armistice Day, he was hospitalized at Roosevelt Hospital at 428 West 59th Street in Manhattan for inflammatory rheumatism and a pulmonary embolism.

Released on Christmas Day 1918, Roosevelt returned to Sagamore Hill. On January 6, 1919, at approximately 4:00 AM, Theodore Roosevelt died in his sleep in his second-floor bedroom at Sagamore Hill, with Edith at his bedside. He was sixty years old. Vice President Thomas Marshall remarked, "Death had to take Roosevelt sleeping, for if he had been awake, there would have been a fight."

On January 8, 1919, a funeral service was held at Christ Church in Oyster Bay, followed by burial at Youngs Memorial Cemetery on a hillside overlooking the bay. Thousands lined the route. His grave remains there today, marked by a simple headstone, a modest memorial for one of the most energetic and consequential figures in American history—a New Yorker who transformed the presidency and redefined the relationship between government, business, and the natural world.
