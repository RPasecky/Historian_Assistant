# Edith Wharton: Chronicler of New York Society

## Gilded Age Childhood (1862-1885)

Edith Newbold Jones was born on January 24, 1862, at 14 West 23rd Street in Manhattan, into one of New York's oldest and wealthiest families. The phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" allegedly referred to her father's family. Her parents, George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander, embodied Old New York aristocracy—wealthy, conservative, and deeply concerned with social propriety.

The family maintained multiple residences, spending winters at 14 West 23rd Street and summers at Pencraig, their estate in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1866, facing financial pressures from the Civil War's economic aftermath, the family departed for Europe on April 3, aboard the steamer Java from New York Harbor. They would spend six years abroad, living in Rome at Via delle Quattro Fontane, in Paris at the Hôtel de l'Athénée, and in Germany.

The family returned to New York on July 4, 1872, settling into a brownstone at 28 West 25th Street. Young Edith, now ten years old, struggled to adapt to New York after her European childhood. She was educated privately at home, developing her literary ambitions in the library on the second floor of the West 25th Street house. At age eleven, in the summer of 1873, she completed a novella titled "Fast and Loose," written in secret in her bedroom.

On October 29, 1877, Edith made her formal debut into New York society at a ball held at Delmonico's restaurant at Fifth Avenue and 26th Street. At fifteen, she was younger than most debutantes, reflecting her family's eagerness to secure her marriage. The next several years were spent in the ritualized social performances of elite New York: balls at Patriarch's, dinners at the homes of Astors and Vanderbilts, summers at Newport.

On April 29, 1885, at age twenty-three, Edith married Edward "Teddy" Robbins Wharton, a socially prominent Bostonian, at Trinity Chapel at 15 West 25th Street (now the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava). The marriage was conventional but emotionally unsatisfying from the start. The couple honeymoored in Europe, then settled into a life divided between a house at 884 Park Avenue in Manhattan (purchased in 1891) and Land's End, a cottage in Newport acquired in 1893.

## Literary Emergence (1885-1905)

Wharton's first publication appeared in 1891 when Scribner's Magazine accepted her poem "The Last Giustiniani." She wrote it at her writing desk in the drawing room at 884 Park Avenue, where she maintained a disciplined morning writing routine. Her first book, a collaboration with architect Ogden Codman Jr. titled "The Decoration of Houses," was published on December 1, 1897, by Scribner's, whose offices were located at 153-157 Fifth Avenue.

On June 23, 1899, Wharton signed a contract with Scribner's for her first collection of short stories, "The Greater Inclination," in the publisher's offices. The book was published in 1899 to critical acclaim. She continued writing at a feverish pace, often composing in bed each morning at Land's End in Newport before receiving visitors in the afternoon.

The strain of her marriage intensified as Teddy exhibited increasing mental instability. On October 28, 1901, the Whartons purchased land in Lenox, Massachusetts, and began construction of The Mount, a grand estate designed by Edith herself. Construction was completed on September 25, 1902, and The Mount became her primary residence and writing headquarters. The house at 113 Plunkett Street overlooked Laurel Lake, and it was here that Wharton wrote some of her most important early works.

On October 14, 1905, "The House of Mirth" was published by Scribner's. Wharton had written much of the novel in her bedroom at The Mount during the winter of 1904-05. The book became an immediate bestseller, selling 140,000 copies in its first year. It established Wharton as America's preeminent novelist of manners, dissecting the very New York society into which she had been born.

## Transatlantic Life and Divorce (1906-1913)

Beginning in 1906, Wharton spent increasing time in Paris, maintaining an apartment at 58 Rue de Varenne in the 7th arrondissement. On March 6, 1908, she began a passionate affair with Morton Fullerton, an American journalist, which commenced after a meeting at the Hôtel Crillon on the Place de la Concorde. The affair, conducted in Paris hotels and her Rue de Varenne apartment, awakened Wharton emotionally and sexually at age forty-five.

Meanwhile, Teddy's mental health deteriorated catastrophically. In 1909, Wharton discovered he had embezzled $50,000 from her trust fund and spent it on a Boston apartment and mistress. The revelation occurred on October 17, 1909, when her lawyer, Walter Berry, presented evidence at her Paris apartment. She was devastated but determined to end the marriage.

On April 16, 1911, The Mount was sold for $180,000. Wharton could not bear to return to the estate after Teddy's betrayal. She departed America aboard the steamer Lusitania from New York Harbor on May 11, 1911, intending to make Paris her permanent home. On April 16, 1913, her divorce from Teddy was finalized in Paris. She was fifty-one years old and finally free.

## Paris, War, and Literary Triumph (1913-1920)

Wharton established herself at 53 Rue de Varenne, a ground-floor apartment with a garden, which became her Paris base. She also maintained Pavillon Colombe, an 18th-century house in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, just north of Paris, purchased on October 25, 1918. These two residences would be her homes for the remainder of her life.

When World War I erupted on August 3, 1914, Wharton was at Pavillon Colombe. She immediately threw herself into war relief, establishing workrooms for unemployed seamstresses at 69 Avenue des Champs-Élysées on August 14, 1914. By October 1914, she had created the American Hostel for Refugees at 23 Boulevard Raspail, providing housing and aid to displaced Belgians and French.

On February 20, 1915, Wharton made the first of five trips to the French front lines, visiting military hospitals and refugee centers. She traveled to Verdun on March 19, 1915, and witnessed the devastation firsthand, later writing accounts for Scribner's Magazine. On April 18, 1916, President Raymond Poincaré awarded her the Légion d'Honneur at the Élysée Palace in Paris—one of the first American women so honored.

Despite her wartime activities, Wharton continued writing. On October 14, 1920, "The Age of Innocence" was published by D. Appleton & Company (headquarters at 35 West 32nd Street in New York). The novel, a piercing examination of 1870s New York society, was written primarily at Pavillon Colombe during the final year of the war. On May 21, 1921, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction—the first time a woman had received the award. Wharton was in Paris when she received the telegram announcing the honor.

## Expatriate Eminence (1920-1937)

Wharton never returned to live in America after 1911, though she maintained intense interest in and connection to New York through her writing. On December 3, 1923, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University, the first woman to receive this honor, though she did not attend the ceremony in New Haven, sending her acceptance from Paris.

She maintained a rigorous writing schedule at Pavillon Colombe and her winter residence, Sainte-Claire du Château in Hyères on the French Riviera, purchased on December 15, 1927. Each morning, she wrote in bed, completing novels, short stories, poetry, and criticism at a remarkable pace. On November 6, 1924, "Old New York," a collection of four novellas set in 19th-century Manhattan, was published by D. Appleton.

In 1928, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Though she did not win, the nomination acknowledged her status as one of the world's leading novelists. On November 2, 1929, her novel "Hudson River Bracketed" was published, followed by its sequel "The Gods Arrive" on April 22, 1932. Both examined American literary culture and were written at Pavillon Colombe.

Her final years were spent between Pavillon Colombe and Hyères, surrounded by a close circle of friends including art critic Bernard Berenson and novelist Percy Lubbock. She continued revising a manuscript titled "The Buccaneers," a novel set in 1870s New York and England, working on it at her writing desk at Pavillon Colombe throughout the spring of 1937.

On June 1, 1937, Edith Wharton suffered a severe stroke at Pavillon Colombe. She lingered for several months, drifting in and out of consciousness. On August 11, 1937, at 5:30 PM, she died in her bedroom at the Pavillon at age seventy-five. Her last words, reportedly spoken to a nurse arranging flowers, were: "I want to be alone with my flowers."

A funeral service was held on August 14, 1937, at the American Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at 23 Avenue George V in Paris. She was buried at the Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles, in a plot alongside Walter Berry, her longtime friend and literary advisor, who had died in 1927. Her tombstone bears only her name and dates, with an epitaph from Dante: "O anima cortese Mantovana" (O courteous Mantuan soul).

Edith Wharton left behind a legacy of more than forty books and a penetrating examination of American society, particularly the New York elite into which she was born. Though she spent the final decades of her life in France, her greatest works—"The House of Mirth," "The Age of Innocence," "The Custom of the Country"—were unflinching portraits of Old New York, capturing a world of rigid social codes and repressed desires with psychological precision and devastating wit. She transformed her imprisonment within that society's conventions into art that transcended its limitations, becoming one of America's greatest novelists and the finest chronicler of Gilded Age New York.
