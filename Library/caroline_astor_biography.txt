# Caroline Schermerhorn Astor: The Mrs. Astor

## Dutch Aristocracy (1830-1853)

Caroline Webster Schermerhorn was born on September 22, 1830, at 12 State Street in Lower Manhattan, into one of New York's most distinguished Dutch families. Her father, Abraham Schermerhorn, was a shipping magnate whose family had settled in New Amsterdam in the 1630s. Her mother, Helen Van Courtlandt White, descended from another colonial Dutch family. The Schermerhorns represented Old New York money, tradition, and impeccable lineage.

Caroline grew up in the Schermerhorn mansion at 12 State Street, overlooking New York Harbor. The house, built in the Federal style, occupied one of Manhattan's most prestigious addresses. She was educated at home by private tutors, learning French, music, and the elaborate social protocols expected of women of her class. By the 1840s, the family also maintained a country estate in Astoria, Queens, then a rural area named after the Astor family.

On June 26, 1846, at age fifteen, Caroline attended her first major social event at the home of John Jacob Astor at his mansion at 223 Broadway. There she met William Backhouse Astor Jr., grandson of John Jacob Astor and heir to America's greatest fortune. Despite the Astors' wealth surpassing that of the Schermerhorns, Caroline's family lineage was far more distinguished—the Astors were nouveau riche fur traders, while the Schermerhorns were colonial aristocracy.

After a lengthy courtship, Caroline married William Backhouse Astor Jr. on September 29, 1853, at Calvary Church at Fourth Avenue and 21st Street. She was twenty-three; he was twenty-four. The marriage united old lineage with new wealth, though socially the Schermerhorn name brought more prestige than the Astor fortune. The couple honeymooned in Europe, traveling through England, France, and Italy.

## Building a Social Empire (1853-1880)

The newlyweds initially resided at 62 East 20th Street, but on March 15, 1859, William's father gave them a mansion at 350 Fifth Avenue at 34th Street as a wedding gift. This brownstone would become Caroline's headquarters for social dominance. She gave birth to five children between 1854 and 1864: Emily (1854), Helen (1855), Charlotte (1858), Caroline (1861), and John Jacob IV (1864). All were born at the Fifth Avenue residence.

For years, Caroline deferred to her sister-in-law, Augusta Astor, wife of William's older brother John Jacob III, who lived next door at 338 Fifth Avenue. Augusta considered herself the leader of New York society by virtue of being married to the senior Astor brother. However, on December 3, 1875, Augusta died at her Fifth Avenue home, leaving a power vacuum at the apex of New York society.

Caroline moved decisively to claim Augusta's position. On January 11, 1876, she hosted her first major ball at 350 Fifth Avenue, inviting precisely four hundred guests—the number her ballroom could comfortably accommodate. This event established what became known as "The Four Hundred," the exclusive list of families deemed acceptable to New York's highest society. Working with social arbiter Ward McAllister, she would refine and guard this list jealously for decades.

Her ally in social supremacy was Ward McAllister, whom she had met on February 14, 1872, at a dinner party at the Union Club at Fifth Avenue and 21st Street. McAllister, a Georgia-born lawyer turned social impresario, became her court chamberlain, gatekeeping access to elite society on her behalf. Together, they created the Patriarchs, an exclusive group of twenty-five men who hosted subscription balls at Delmonico's at Fifth Avenue and 26th Street, beginning on February 7, 1873.

## The Mrs. Astor (1880-1906)

By 1880, Caroline Astor had become known simply as "The Mrs. Astor," a title acknowledging her position as the undisputed queen of New York society. No invitation was more coveted than one to her annual ball, held each January at 350 Fifth Avenue. On January 12, 1881, she held her most spectacular ball yet, with decorations costing $50,000 and featuring thousands of orchids imported from her greenhouses in Rhinebeck, New York.

Her power was dramatized in a famous confrontation with the Vanderbilts. Alva Vanderbilt, wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt, was planning a magnificent costume ball for March 26, 1883, at their new mansion at 660 Fifth Avenue at 52nd Street. When Mrs. Astor's daughter Carrie expressed desire to attend, Caroline faced a dilemma: she had never formally recognized the Vanderbilts as social equals, yet her daughter desperately wanted to participate. On March 20, 1883, Caroline made a formal call at 660 Fifth Avenue, leaving her card for Mrs. Vanderbilt—a symbolic surrender that acknowledged the Vanderbilts' arrival in elite society.

In 1893, William Backhouse Astor commissioned architect Richard Morris Hunt to build a new mansion. Construction was completed on November 1, 1896, and the family moved into the palatial residence at 840 Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The ballroom could accommodate eight hundred guests, double the capacity of the previous house. On January 18, 1897, Caroline held her first ball in the new mansion, cementing her reign from this new palace.

Her annual balls followed rigid protocols. On January 13, 1902, at her ball at 840 Fifth Avenue, guests arriving at the porte-cochère were received by liveried footmen and announced by a major-domo as they descended the grand staircase. Mrs. Astor stood before a massive portrait of herself by Carolus-Duran, wearing her famous diamond tiara and stomacher (a bodice ornament) containing some of the finest diamonds in America, valued at over $200,000.

Her authority extended beyond balls. She determined which families were received in polite society, which marriages were acceptable, and which social climbers would be forever excluded. On March 3, 1892, at a meeting of the Patriarchs held at Delmonico's, she and McAllister finalized the definitive list of The Four Hundred, which was published in The New York Times on February 16, 1892, causing sensation and controversy.

## Decline and Final Years (1906-1908)

William Backhouse Astor Jr. suffered from mental illness in his final years and died on April 25, 1892, at their mansion at 840 Fifth Avenue. His death freed Caroline from a difficult marriage but also began her gradual decline. She continued hosting her annual balls, but her authority was challenged by a new generation of wealthy families—the Fricks, the Carnegies, the Rockefellers—whose fortunes dwarfed the Astors'.

Her son, John Jacob Astor IV, married on February 17, 1891, at Grace Church at Broadway and 10th Street, to Ava Lowle Willing of Philadelphia. However, the marriage deteriorated, and when John Jacob divorced Ava in 1909 and married the eighteen-year-old Madeleine Force on September 9, 1911, at Beechwood, the Astor estate in Newport, society was scandalized. By then, however, Caroline was too far gone mentally to react.

Caroline's mental faculties began failing around 1904. On February 2, 1906, she made her final public appearance at her annual ball at 840 Fifth Avenue. Witnesses noted she seemed confused, at one point greeting guests who weren't present and speaking to people who had died years earlier. After this ball, she retreated from public life entirely.

She spent her final years in increasing dementia, confined to her bedroom on the second floor of 840 Fifth Avenue. Her daughter Charlotte and nurses attended her constantly. On October 30, 1908, at 4:30 PM, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor died in her bedroom at age seventy-eight. The cause was listed as heart failure, but she had effectively been lost to dementia for several years.

A funeral service was held on November 2, 1908, at 840 Fifth Avenue, conducted by the rector of Trinity Church. Only family members attended. She was buried in the family vault at Trinity Church Cemetery at 155th Street and Broadway, alongside William. Her will, probated on November 15, 1908, at the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, revealed an estate valued at approximately $5 million, far less than many assumed—most of the Astor fortune had passed to her son.

The mansion at 840 Fifth Avenue was demolished in 1926 to make way for Temple Emanu-El. The social world Caroline Astor had ruled with absolute authority—a New York society based on lineage, manners, and exclusivity—did not long survive her. The new century brought new fortunes and new values. The Four Hundred became a quaint anachronism. Yet for a generation, from the 1870s through the early 1900s, no one exercised more power over New York society than Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, who determined through sheer force of will who belonged and who did not in the most exclusive drawing rooms of the Gilded Age.
